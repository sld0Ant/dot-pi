# Development Guidelines

## Adding New Components

When adding new extensions, skills, or rules:
1. Add entry to the corresponding table in `README.md`
2. Keep tables alphabetically sorted
3. Include Origin column with link to source if adapted from another project
4. Commit both the component and README update together
